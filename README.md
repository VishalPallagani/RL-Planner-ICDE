# RL-Planner


Requirements to run code:

Attached in the reqs.txt

Most of the libraries are commonly used and should be on your machine already. 
If not, in most notebook applications you can do the following to install a package that is missing:

!pip install "package name"

You could also install a package using pip from the terminal. 
The script will alert you if any packages are missing. 



Please follow the below instructions to run the notebooks containing the Baseline (OMEGA) and RL-Planner

1) Download the repository onto your local machine as is, without changing the file structure
2) Open notebooks using an editor of your choice

	-Editor must support 2 space indentation. Please ensure this. 
  
	-One potential option is Microsoft Visual Studio Code. Other editors should work as well
  
3) The course recommendation will be towards the end of the notebook 


The file structure is laid out as follows:

1) Code for Univ-1 and Univ-2 is in one file
2) Data used is in another file

* There is randomization in the code, so it needs to be run a few times.

Theoretical details on the model and baseline are in our work.
